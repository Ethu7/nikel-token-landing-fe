        <CustomHeader2>About Nickel</CustomHeader2>
        <p>
          Nickel, with its silvery “lustre”, stands at the innovation helm of
          critical sectors like aerospace, battery technology, renewable energy,
          and tire manufacturing. Its pivotal role in driving the technologies
          of tomorrow is underscored by the anticipated market expansion from
          USD 36.27 billion in 2021 to a robust USD 59.14 billion by 2028.
          Nickel's exceptional versatility and adaptability render it essential
          across a spectrum of uses, ranging from the production of everyday
          items such as coins to pioneering roles in advanced technological
          developments, thereby reshaping traditional industries.
          <br />
          <br />
          In light of nickel's potential to significantly impact our future, we
          are committed to pioneering a novel, strategic framework for its
          management, utilization, and innovation. This initiative is grounded
          in a thorough grasp of the existing hurdles within the nickel
          industry, aiming to nurture sustainable innovation and spearhead
