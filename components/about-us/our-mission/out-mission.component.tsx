        <CustomHeader2>Our Story</CustomHeader2>
        <p>
          We see Nickel playing a pivotal role in shaping our future as its
          global demand soars higher. We know the unique properties of NKL1
          and how alloying it with other materials will unlock more remarkable
          properties like corrosion resistance, exceptional high-temperature
          strength, and shape memory. This uniqueness makes Nickel an
          exceptional material for innovation.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, we discovered that the Nickel industry is disjointed,
          fractured, and compartmentalized. Stakeholders work in isolation,
          leading to limited collaboration and knowledge-sharing. These are the
          problems we intend to solve. Our solution is to build an ecosystem and
          community that fosters: ideas capturing, collaboration, communication,
          and connecting Nickel innovators, researchers, engineers, financiers,
          partners, and developers.
          <br />
          <br />
          We want to give the Nickel industry and its stakeholders a new,
          intuitive experience where they could come together to make a change.
          With new technology and work ethics, we create a community of nickel
          investors, researchers, companies, and the public to refine, share,
          collaborate, and develop ideas and innovations.
