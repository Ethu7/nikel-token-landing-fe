        and tokens. Thus, Nikel Token offers the users the use of the "Software
        as a service" (SaaS, hereinafter called "Software") that makes it
        possible to link digital files provided by the users to a so-called
        Non-Fungible Token (NFT), which can be inseparably assigned to the file
        via the Polygon Blockchain and thus authenticates the file as such, so
        that it can be recognized as such at anytime and it becomes possible to
        assign it to a concrete owner/proprietor (via connection to the latter's
        Polygon wallet). The process is hereinafter referred to as
        "Certification".
      </p>
      <p>Storage Space:</p>
      <p>
        Nikel Token grants users storage space on servers and networks for
        storing its data. Users may store digital files on these servers and
        networks. Nikel Token will ensure that the stored data is accessible via
        the Internet within the scope of the functioning of the software. The
        user is not entitled to transfer this storage space to a third party for
        use, either in part or in full, against payment or free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user undertakes not to store any content on the storage space whose
        provision, publication or use violates Applicable Law or agreements with
        third parties. In particular, the contents may not
      </p>
      <p>
        a) violate legal prohibitions (in particular regulations of criminal law
        and competition law), morality and the Intellectual Property Rights of
        third parties; and/or
      </p>
      <p>b) be racist, glorify violence or similarly reprehensible.</p>

        To the extent that a properly submitted notice of default in connection
        with theSoftware is justified, we will remedy the defect. Our
        performance exclusively comprises either the delivery of a Software
        update (-fix) or a corrected version. If we are unable to remedy the
        defect or fail to remedy the defect within a reasonable period of time,

      <p>
        If the user has asserted a warranty claim against us and it is
        determined that either there is no defect or that the claimed defect

        us for all expenses incurred because of the user's gross negligence or
        willful misconduct.
      </p>
      <h3>Assumption of Risk</h3>
      <p>You accept and acknowledge:</p>
      <p>
        a) The value of a TOKEN OR NFTs is subjective. Prices of TOKENS OR NFTs
        are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of
        cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect TOKEN OR NFT
        prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and
        volatility and that you may lose money;
      </p>
      <p>
        b) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
        distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those
        ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively
        impact the potential utility of TOKENS OR NFTs;
      </p>
      <p>
        c) The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible
        tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and
        new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the
        development of the Service and the utility of TOKENS OR NFTs;
      </p>
      <p>
        d) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply
        to your transactions. Nikel Token is not responsible for determining the
        taxes that apply to your TOKENS OR NFTs;
      </p>
      <p>
        e) Nikel Token does not control the public blockchains that you are
        interacting with and does not control certain smart contracts and
        protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions
        on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are
        irreversible and Nikel Token has no ability to reverse any transactions
        on the blockchain; and
      </p>
      <p>
        f) There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based
        products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with
        hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious
        software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
        unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept
        and acknowledge that Nikel Token will not be responsible for any
        communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you
        may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however
        caused.

      <h3>4.9 Liability for Services and the Software</h3>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL
        Nikel Token OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY
        FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THESE TERMS OR THE

        RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR
        ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND
        WHETHER CAUSED BY STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),BREACH
        OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF Nikel Token
        OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES; OR (B)FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM, DEMAND, OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
        RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF
        THE DELIVERY, USE, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF,
        THE SERVICE, PRODUCTS OR THIRD-PARTY SITES, AND PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN
        DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
        TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING
        THEREFROM.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOT WITH STANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT
        SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF Nikel Token ARISING OUT OF OR
        IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE,
        CONTENT, NFTS, OR ANY OTHER Nikel Token PRODUCTS OR SERVICES EXCEED THE
        AMOUNT RECEIVED BY US FOR OUR SERVICE DIRECTLY RELATING TO THE ITEMS
        THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY
        EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
        exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit
        disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from
        consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury
        claims.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Fees and Payments</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Using the Nikel Token_ platform and granting of storage space</h3>
      <p>
        The sole possibility of using the Nikel Token platform and its API as
        well as granting of storage space after account registration is free of
        charge.
      </p>
      <h3>5.2 Software as a service (SaaS) for generating NFT's</h3>
      <p>
        Each minting process (Certification), is linked to a usage fee, which is
        due upon the successful sale of a TOKEN OR NFT. The payment is not made
        in Fiat but by transfer of cryptocurrencies. The usage fee regarding the
        Services in cryptocurrencies shall be determined by the Nikel Token
        price list valid at the time of the certification process.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is understood and agreed between the Parties that any payments made
        and any other consideration given under this Agreement are each
        exclusive of any value added(“VAT”), which shall be added thereon as
        applicable and at the relevant rate.Where VAT is properly charged by the
        supplying Party and added to a payment made or other consideration
        provided (as applicable) under this Agreement, the Party making the
        payment or providing the other consideration (as applicable)will pay the
        amount of VAT properly chargeable only on receipt of a valid tax invoice
        from the supplying Party issued in accordance with the laws and
        regulations of the country in which the VAT is chargeable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each party will be responsible for complying with any and all
        obligations imposed on it under applicable law with respect to the
        collection and payment of any Taxes. Each party will cooperate with the
        other party, and furnish the other party with any customary written
        documentation or forms required under applicable law to enable the other
        party to comply with such obligations or to exercise any rights
        available under applicable law to minimize or to qualify for an
        exemption from any such obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the provider of the Polygon technology, in this respect might
        charge the customer a further fee for the performance of the process,
        according to their own current price list.
      </p>
      <p>We accept the following forms of payment:</p>
      <p>
        The technical processing of payments takes place on the Polygon
        blockchain in a single transaction. The End Customer has to pay the
        price agreed with the Customer in the form of cryptocurrencies to the
        Customer. The connection of the API or the publication of the project
        wallet address result sin the automatic deduction, as part of the TOKEN
        OR NFT file creation, of both the usage fee owed between the Customer
        and the Nikel Token and the fee owed between the Customer and the
        technology provider from the cryptocurrency amount paid by the End
        Customer.
