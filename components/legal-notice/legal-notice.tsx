          <p>
            When you sign up for our newsletter and consent to receive

            Our newsletter using an external provider can contain a so-called
            web beacon (tracking pixel) or similar technical means. A web beacon
            is a 1x1 pixel, invisible graphic that is associated with the user
            ID of the respective newsletter subscriber or mail recipient.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            For each newsletter or other marketing communication sent, there is
            information on the address file used, the subject and the number of
            emails sent. Furthermore, it is possible to see which recipients
            have not yet received the newsletter or other communication, to
            which recipients they were sent and for which recipients the sending
            failed.It is also possible to see which recipients have opened the
            newsletter or other communication. And finally, it is possible to
            see which recipients have unsubscribed. We use this data for
            statistical purposes and to optimize the content and structure of
            the newsletter and our other communication with you.This enables us
            to better tailor the information and offers in our newsletter and
            our marketing communication in general to the individual interests
            of the recipients. The tracking pixel is deleted when you delete the
            newsletter or email.
          </p>

            other communication, please set your mail program so that no HTML is
            displayed in messages, if this is not already the case by default.

            We store the personal data affected by and mentioned in these data
            privacy notices in a central electronic data processing system. In
            addition to the aforementioned processing purposes, we also use this
            personal data to optimize the organization and management of our
            business relations with you. For this purpose, we assign various
            characteristics to you in our central data processing system (e.g.
            which areas of law you are interested in, etc.). We derive these
            characteristics from the information provided by you or the data
            collected about you as mentioned above.However, we do not carry out
            comprehensive profiling for this purpose. The following personal
            data in particular are relevant for these purposes:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>- Name, title, Gender</p>
          <p>- Contact details</p>
          <p>- business email</p>

            meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR for the customer-friendly and
            efficient management of customer data. The processing also takes
            place in order to display interest-related content to you on the
            Websites or in our communication with you. The legal basis for this
            processing is then also the fulfillment of the contract within the
            meaning of Art. 6 para.1 lit. b GDPR. You can object to this data
            processing at any time (see section12 "Contact").

            central data processing system to send you information about us and
            our services (e.g. information about events organized by us that
            might interest you, information about current legal developments

          This information is transmitted to Google servers in the USA and
          stored there. In doing so, the IP address is shortened by activating
          IP anonymization (“anonymizeIP”) on the Websites before transmission
          within the Member States of the European Union or in other Contracting
          States of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, as well as in

          part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
          Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a
          Google server in the USA and shortened there. In these cases, we
          ensure that Google complies with a sufficient level of data protection
          by means of contractual guarantees, in particular by agreeing to the

          transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by
          law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s

          When you open a link to one of our social media presences, a direct
          connection is established between your browser and the server of the
          social network in question. This provides the network with the
          information that you have visited our Websites with your IP address
          and accessed the link. If you access a link to a network while logged
          into your account on the network concerned, the content of our

        <p>Disclosure of data to third parties</p>
        <p>
          We consider the personal data referred to in this Privacy Policy to be
          confidential and will treat it accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not disclose this information to third parties unless it is
          necessary to comply with laws, court orders or legal proceedings, to
          enforce or apply our agreements or to protect us or our rights, or
          unless you have expressly consented to this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we share your data with third parties to the extent
          necessary for the use of the Websites, the processing of your contact
          requests, the sending of marketing communications and the analysis of
          your user behavior, as well as for other processing purposes mentioned
          above. The use of the data disclosed for this purpose by the third
          parties is strictly limited to the aforementioned purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Various third-party service providers are explicitly mentioned in this
          privacy policy (e.g. in section 4"Tracking tools"). Other service
          providers to which personal data collected via the Websites are
          disclosed or to which they have or may have access are the companies
          that implement the Websites . The aforementioned data, which is
          collected when you access and use the Websites, is stored on servers
          in Frankfurt, Germany. The data is passed on for the purpose of
          providing and maintaining the functionalities of our Websites. In this
          processing, we rely on our legitimate interests within the meaning of
          Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>Transfer of personal data abroad</p>
        <p>
          We may transfer your data to third parties (contracted service
          providers) based abroad for the purposes of the data processing
          described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such third party companies are obliged to protect the privacy of
          individuals to the same extent as we do. Ift he level of data
          protection in a country does not correspond to the Swiss or European
          level, we contractually ensure that the protection of your personal
          data corresponds to that in Switzerland or the EU at all times. To
          this end, we agree on the EU standard contractual clauses with the
          partners and implement additional technical and organizational
          measures, if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain third-party providers mentioned in this privacy policy are
          based in the USA (see section 5"Links to our social media presences").
          Further explanations of the data that maybe transferred to the USA can
          be found below under section 8"Note on data transfers to the USA".
        </p>
        <p>Note on data transfers to the USA</p>
        <p>
          Some of the third-party service providers mentioned in this Privacy
          Policy are based in the USA. For the sake of completeness, we would
          like to point out for users who are resident or domiciled in
          Switzerland or the EU that there are surveillance measures in place in
          the USA by US authorities, which generally allow the storage of all
          personal data of all persons whose data has been transferred from
          Switzerland or the EU to the USA. This is done without any
          differentiation, limitation or exception based on the objective
          pursued and without any objective criterion that would make it
          possible to limit the access of the US authorities to the data and
          their subsequent use to very specific, strictly limited purposes that
          are capable of justifying the intrusion associated with both the
          access to and the use of this data. Furthermore, we would like to
          point out that in the USA, data subjects from Switzerland or the EU do
          not have any legal remedies that allow them to obtain access to the
          data concerning them and to obtain their correction or deletion, or
          that there is no effective judicial legal protection against general
          access rights of US authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to point out to users who are resident in Switzerland or
          a member state of the EU that the USA does not have a sufficient level
          of data protection from the point of view of the European Union and
          Switzerland - among other things due to the issues mentioned in this
          section. Insofar as we have explained in this Privacy Policy that
          recipients of data (such as Google) are based in the USA, we will
          ensure through contractual arrangements with these companies, as well
          as any additional appropriate guarantees required, that your data is
          protected with our partners at an appropriate level.
        </p>
        <p>Right to information, deletion, and correction</p>
        <p>
          You can object to data processing, in particular data processing in

          the opportunity to check what personal data we process about you and
          that we use in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.
        </p>
        <p>Right to rectification:</p>
        <p>

          that we use in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.
        </p>
        <p>Right to erasure:</p>
        <p>
          You have the right to have your personal data erased in certain

        </p>
        <p>Right to restrict processing:</p>
        <p>
          You have the right, under certain conditions, to request that the
          processing of your personal data be restricted.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are a resident of an EU or EEA Member State, you have the
          right, in certain circumstances, to obtain from us, free of charge,
          the personal data you have provided to us in a readable format
        </p>
        <p>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</p>

          If you are a resident of an EU or EEA member state, you have the right
          to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority about the
          way in which your personal data is processed.
        </p>
        <p>Right of withdrawal:</p>
        <p>
          In principle, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
          However, processing activities based on your consent in the past do
          not become unlawful as a result of your withdrawal.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Retention periods</h2>
        <p>
          We only retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide you
          with services that you have requested or for purposes to which you
          have given your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that special statutory retention periods may apply to
          certain data. We must store this data until the end of the retention
          period. We block such data in our system and use it exclusively to
          fulfill our legal obligations.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Data security</h2>
        <p>
          We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to
          protect personal data from loss, misuse or alteration. Nevertheless,
          it is not possible to guarantee the absolute security of personal
          data. In this context, please also note that data transmitted over an
          open network such as the Internet or an e-mail service is openly
          accessible.We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or
          content shared over these networks. If you share personal data over an
          open network, you should be aware that third parties may access this
          data and collect and use it for their own purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also take internal data protection very seriously. Our employees
          and the service companies commissioned by us are obliged by us to
          maintain confidentiality and to comply with the applicable data
          privacy laws.
